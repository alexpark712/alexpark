        <p class = "reading"> Reading is a special hobby to me. I've come to realize the importance in learning different skills and perspectives 
            and reading is one of the few things that allow me to do that. Memoirs, self-improvement, and historical fiction are my preferred genres. 
            My favorite books are <i> This Side of Paradise </i> (F. Scott Fitzgerald), <i> On the Road </i> (Jack Kerouac), 
            <i> Educated </i> (Tara Westover), <i> Robinson Crusoe </i> (Daniel Defoe), and <i> The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People </i> (Stephen Covey).  
            Feel free to contact me with any book reccomendations!

    <div class = "soccer_info"> 
        <p class = "soccer"> Soccer has always been my favorite sport and I've played for as long as I can remember. Countless hours on the field at the club and
            high school level and competing with some of my best friends is definitely something I miss now that I am older. Besides the exercise it gives me, 
            soccer is a great creative outlet for me as I can do anything with the ball and try new tricks and shots. I'm always up for some friendly competition 
            and local pickup games!  
        </p>

    <div class = "cooking_info">
        <p class = "cooking"> Cooking has been an activity I've only recently picked up. As a self-proclaimed food enthusiast, being able to create my own 
            meals and playing around with different ingredients is quite fulfilling. Some of my favorite recipes to make are Bucatini Amatriciana, Lemon Garlic 
            Swordfish Steak, Pesto Panko Parmesan Chicken Breast, and a Seasoned Crispy Tofu Medley. Reach out with some of your best recipes!      
        </p>

    <div class = "photovideo_info">
        <p class = "photovideo"> Photography and videography are also other creative outlets that I enjoy as well. I like to see places I've been, 
            people I've met, and things I did in the past, and photos and videos are the perfect way to look back on these special memories. 
            Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop are essential when I edit my videos and photos, and I am starting to get into graphic design as well. There's 
            nothing like being able to watch your past come to life on camera!     
        </p>

    <div class = "entrepreneurship_info">
        <p class = "entrepreneurship"> Entrepreneurship has always been a topic I've been fascinated with. Growing up, I loved the idea of creating a business from
            nothing and building it up to such great heights and <i> Shark Tank </i> was always a show I enjoyed watching. At Boston College, I am now able to put 
            my ideas to action as a part of the Shea Center of Entrepreneurship and get advice from some alumni who have had successful ventures. Hopefully someday 
            I too can make a profitable company that changes the world for the better!
